# Financial-Portfolio-Analysis



## Overview
This project provides an in-depth financial risk analysis of five high-risk assets: Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), and Moderna Inc. (MRNA). Utilizing advanced statistical techniques and financial models, the study aims to identify, measure, and mitigate the risks associated with these investments.

## Key Features

### Risk Analysis
- **Daily Returns and Share Prices:** Detailed analysis and plotting of daily returns and share prices for each asset.
- **Statistical Measures:** Calculation of sample mean, variance, and standard deviation for logarithmic or linear returns.
- **Variance-Covariance Matrix:** Computation and interpretation of the variance-covariance matrix for asset returns.

### Financial Models
- **Altman Z-score and Credit Risk Models:** Application of these models to assess the financial health and credit risk of the assets.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Utilization of simulations to forecast future price movements and risks.
- **Efficient Frontier and Optimal Portfolio Selection:** Construction and analysis of the efficient frontier to determine optimal portfolios based on risk-return profiles.

### Regression Analysis
- **Linear Regression:** Analysis using the S&P 500 as a proxy for the market portfolio, including alpha, beta, and noise coefficients.

### Portfolio Performance
- **Comparison with Market Index:** Analysis of the constructed portfolio's performance against the S&P 500.
- **Investment Strategies:** Evaluation of the effectiveness of asset protection strategies using call and put options.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Historical data for the selected assets were collected and processed.
2. **Statistical Analysis:** Advanced statistical techniques were applied to compute daily returns, share prices, and key statistical measures.
3. **Financial Modeling:** Models such as the Altman Z-score, Monte Carlo simulations, and credit risk models were utilized to assess risks.
4. **Efficient Frontier:** The efficient frontier was plotted, and utility functions were used to select optimal portfolios.
5. **Performance Comparison:** The portfolio's performance was compared to the S&P 500 index, and the effectiveness of asset protection strategies was studied.

## Tools and Technologies
- **MATLAB:** For statistical analysis, financial modeling, and plotting.
- **Excel:** For data storage and manipulation.
- **Financial Libraries:** For advanced financial calculations and simulations.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the volatility and potential returns of high-risk assets, aiding investors and financial analysts in managing portfolio risks and optimizing investment strategies.
